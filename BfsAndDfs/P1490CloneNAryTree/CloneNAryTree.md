# 1490. CloneNAryTree

## BFS
- Using Queue to guarantee the order of pop nodes.
- Using Hashmap to map the original node to the new cloned node. 
- Using Level order traversal to clone node
- Time complexity: Since we have to visit all nodes of the tree, so the space complexity is O(N)
- Space complexity: the same as time complexity

## DFS
